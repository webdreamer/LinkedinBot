# LinkedIn-Auto-Connect-Custom-Message

This python scripts uses Python's Selenium Web-Driver.

It search for people with certain keyword, and auto-connect to them with custom message.

To run this script, copy your current Chrome instance to another directive.

You can also customize your messages when you send an connect request to the people you want to have connection with.

Linkedin modifies the classes of the HTML dom elements every 2~3 months, so you might have to look for the classes by yourself and change them.
